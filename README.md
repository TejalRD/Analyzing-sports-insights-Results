## Project Abstract

Sites like Twitter, Reddit and Youtube have given people a platform to engage with a single piece of content in many different ways. For developers, this presents an opportunity to measure different metrics on different platforms, and derive insights from the vast amount of data being generated. 
We have two major sporting events comingup: FIFA World cup Qatar 2022 and ICC Menâ€™s T20 Worldcup. In this project, we use three major social media platforms: Twitter, Reddit and Youtube to analyze the popularity of these events indifferent parts of the world, the athletes and how the public engages with them and lastly, abusive content generated through thecourse of the events.
